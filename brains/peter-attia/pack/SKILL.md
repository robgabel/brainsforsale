# Peter Attia Brain Pack — Setup & Configuration

Welcome to the **Attia Brain Pack** from [brainsfor.dev](https://brainsfor.dev). This is a premium knowledge asset extracted from Peter Attia's "The Drive" podcast and reviews of "Outlive" book — a curated collection of his most rigorous thinking on longevity, metabolic health, exercise physiology, and the Four Horsemen of chronic disease.

## What You're Getting

- **73 knowledge atoms** — Core insights, frameworks, and strategic principles from 400+ episodes of The Drive podcast, reviews of Outlive (2023), and detailed blog posts
- **40 typed connections** — Relationships between ideas (supports, contradicts, extends, related, inspired_by)
- **8 specialized thinking skills** — Each a distinct reasoning mode with a unique output type
- **Cross-referenced topics** — Zone 2 training, VO2 max, Four Horsemen, metabolic health, cardiovascular prevention, cancer screening, emotional resilience, sleep, pharmacology, muscle, and more

This brain is designed to augment YOUR thinking — not replace it. Use it for strategic decisions, creative problem-solving, research, and to challenge your assumptions.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Installation

Your Attia Brain Pack folder should contain:

```
pack/
  ├── SKILL.md                 ← you are here (brain-setup)
  ├── brain-context.md         ← full knowledge base + usage guide
  ├── brain-atoms.json         ← structured atoms (73 insights)
  ├── README.md                ← quick reference
  └── skills/                  ← 9 unified skills (work with any installed brain)
      ├── brain/               ← /brain router (set/show/list/clear active brain)
      ├── advise/              ← /advise — strategic counsel
      ├── teach/               ← /teach — explain through the thinker's lens
      ├── debate/              ← /debate — steel-man both sides
      ├── connect/             ← /connect — find unexpected bridges
      ├── evolve/              ← /evolve — trace how thinking changed
      ├── surprise/            ← /surprise — serendipity engine
      ├── coach/               ← /coach — Socratic questioning
      └── predict/             ← /predict — implication chains
```

The `skills/` directory is **brain-agnostic**. Every brain pack ships the same 9 skill files — they resolve which brain to use via the `/brain` router (active brain in `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/state/active-brain.txt`) or via an inline slug override.

If any files are missing, reinstall from [brainsfor.dev](https://brainsfor.dev).

### Step 2: Detect Your AI Environment

This brain works across multiple AI tools. Identify which one you're using:

- **Claude Code** — Run this skill directly; brain context loads automatically
- **Cowork (Claude in Slack)** — Use `/brain-setup` command; Cowork syncs context
- **Cursor** — Paste brain-context.md into `.cursor/rules` or project instructions
- **ChatGPT / Claude.ai** — Copy brain-context.md into system prompt or conversation starter
- **Other tools** — Load brain-context.md as your first message or context injection

### Step 3: Load Brain Context

The brain operates in three layers:

1. **Layer 1 — Quick Reference** (brain-atoms.json)
   - JSON structure of 73 atoms with titles, summaries, connections
   - Ideal for: Rapid lookups, programmatic access, integrations
   - Use when: You need structured data for routing or filtering

2. **Layer 2 — Full Knowledge Base** (brain-context.md)
   - Complete narrative knowledge graph with topic tags, people, themes
   - Ideal for: Deep reasoning, strategy sessions, comprehensive understanding
   - Load this file when: Starting a session that requires brain-informed thinking

3. **Layer 3 — Thinking Skills** (the 8 skills below)
   - Each skill is a reasoning mode that produces a distinct type of output
   - Ideal for: Targeted analysis, creative workflows, decision-making
   - Use when: You have a specific type of problem to solve

**Recommended:** Run `/brain peter-attia` at the start of each session. The router writes the active brain to `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/state/active-brain.txt` and loads `brain-context.md` as session context. After that, the 8 thinking skills (`/advise`, `/teach`, etc.) will use this brain automatically — no need to retype the slug on every call.

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Test your setup with the Quick Start prompt below. You should get a thoughtful response grounded in Peter's thinking.

## The 9 Unified Skills

These skills live in `pack/skills/` and are brain-agnostic — they work with Peter Attia and with any other BrainsFor brain installed under `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/brains/`. Set the active brain with `/brain peter-attia`, or override per call with an inline slug like `/advise peter-attia <question>`.

### 🎛️ **0. /brain** — Router
Set, show, list, or clear the active brain for the session.
*Usage: `/brain peter-attia` activates, `/brain` shows current, `/brain list` shows all installed, `/brain clear` unsets.*

### 🧠 **1. /advise** — Strategic Counsel
Ask for advice on decisions grounded in Peter's frameworks. Best for: career moves, company decisions, strategy choices.
*Example: "I'm 55, overweight, and sedentary. What's my first move?"*

### 📚 **2. /teach** — Explain Like I'm Learning
Get a clear explanation of a concept as Peter sees it. Best for: understanding unfamiliar ideas, building mental models.
*Example: "Explain the Four Horsemen and why they matter."*

### 🔥 **3. /debate** — Steel-Man Both Sides
Present a position or pit two ideas against each other; brain argues the counterpoint. Best for: understanding tradeoffs, challenging assumptions, resolving strategic tensions.
*Example: "Is muscle or cardio more important for longevity?"*

### 🔗 **4. /connect** — Bridge Ideas
Find unexpected connections between two concepts or synthesize multiple ideas into something new. Best for: synthesis, innovation, cross-domain thinking.
*Example: "How does continuous glucose monitoring inform training strategy?"*

### 📈 **5. /evolve** — How Ideas Build On Each Other
Trace how a concept develops and changes across the brain. Best for: historical perspective, maturity models, trajectory thinking.
*Example: "How has Peter's thinking on statins and pharmacology evolved?"*

### 🎨 **6. /surprise** — Unexpected Insights
Get a random high-quality atom you wouldn't think to ask for. Best for: creative breakthroughs, morning inspiration, breaking tunnel vision.
*Example: No input needed — just run it.*

### 🪞 **7. /coach** — Socratic Questions
No answers — just the questions Peter would ask you. Best for: uncovering blind spots, pressure-testing decisions, team discussions.
*Example: "I'm 40 and want to start optimizing for longevity. What should I be asking myself?"*

### 🔮 **8. /predict** — Implication Chains
Trace the second and third-order effects of a trend or decision. Best for: forecasting, strategic planning, seeing around corners.
*Example: "What happens to healthcare if everyone has continuous biomarker monitoring?"*

---

## Recommended Workflows

Use these skill combinations for better results:

### 🎯 Decision Workflow
→ `/advise` (get perspective) → `/debate` (stress-test) → `/coach` (check your blind spots)

*Example: Deciding on a hire? Get advice, challenge the reasoning, then surface what you're not asking.*

### 📚 Learning Workflow
→ `/teach` (understand) → `/evolve` (see how it develops) → `/coach` (test your understanding)

*Example: New to longevity? Teach the Four Horsemen → evolve pharmacology → coach yourself on priorities.*

### 💡 Creative Workflow
→ `/surprise` (get inspired) → `/connect` (build bridges) → `/predict` (where does this lead?)

*Example: Stuck on a problem? Surprise + connect often surface unexpected angles.*

### 🔮 Forecast Workflow
→ `/predict` (trace implications) → `/debate` (challenge the prediction) → `/advise` (act on it)

*Example: Planning your health stack? Predict where health tech is going → debate the tradeoffs → advise on your protocol.*

### 🌅 Daily Ritual
→ Run `/surprise` each morning for 10 seconds of strategic inspiration.

## Quick Start

**Try this right now to verify setup:**

```
/brain peter-attia

/advise "I'm 45 and want to maximize my chances of being healthy at 85. Where do I start?"
```

Or skip the activation step and use an inline slug for a one-off:

```
/advise peter-attia "I'm 45 and want to maximize my chances of being healthy at 85. Where do I start?"
```

You should get a thoughtful response that:
- References specific frameworks from the brain
- Weighs tradeoffs from Peter's perspective
- Suggests which of his mental models apply here
- Feels strategic and grounded (not generic)

If you get that, you're all set.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The brain doesn't seem to know what I'm asking about.**
→ Make sure `brain-context.md` is loaded in your session. If using Claude Code, check that the file is in your working directory.

**Q: I want to search the brain for a specific topic.**
→ Use `/advise` with a keyword: `"What does Peter think about VO2 max?"` → The brain will pull all relevant atoms.

**Q: Can I combine skills?**
→ Absolutely. Chain them: `"First /advise on whether to pivot, then /debate the tradeoffs, then /coach me on what I'm missing."`

**Q: What if a skill doesn't feel relevant to my question?**
→ Try a different one. `/coach` often works when you're stuck; `/connect` when you need something original; `/surprise` when you need inspiration.

**Q: How often should I reload the brain?**
→ Once per session is sufficient. Brain context doesn't expire, and atoms don't change. But if you're switching between different projects, fresh context load = sharper thinking.

## Sources & Ethics

This brain was built exclusively from **freely available, public sources** — {{brain_source_ethics}}. No transcripts from commercial works (e.g., audiobooks, paid courses) or paywalled essays were used to derive this brain.

Where a thinker's book ideas appear in the knowledge graph, they are represented as they exist in the public discourse: book reviews, author interviews, press coverage, conference talks, and widely discussed concepts. Authors typically share their core ideas through extensive public appearances — those public representations are what this brain captures.

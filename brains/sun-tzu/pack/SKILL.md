# Sun Tzu Brain Pack — Setup & Configuration

Welcome to the **Tzu Brain Pack** from [brainsfor.dev](https://brainsfor.dev). This is a premium knowledge asset extracted from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" and attributed historical commentary — a curated collection of his most enduring strategic thinking on warfare, leadership, intelligence, positioning, and the psychology of conflict.

## What You're Getting

- **207 knowledge atoms** — Core insights, frameworks, and strategic principles from 13 chapters of The Art of War, plus centuries of military and strategic commentary attributed to Sun Tzu and his school of thought
- **377 typed connections** — Relationships between ideas (supports, contradicts, extends, related, inspired_by)
- **8 specialized thinking skills** — Each a distinct reasoning mode with a unique output type
- **Cross-referenced topics** — strategic assessment, deception, terrain, momentum, intelligence, leadership, adaptability, timing, resource management, psychological warfare, and more

This brain is designed to augment YOUR thinking — not replace it. Use it for strategic decisions, creative problem-solving, research, and to challenge your assumptions.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Installation

Your Tzu Brain Pack folder should contain:

```
pack/
  ├── SKILL.md                 ← you are here
  ├── brain-context.md         ← full knowledge base + usage guide
  ├── brain-atoms.json         ← structured atoms (207 insights)
  └── README.md                ← quick reference
```

If any files are missing, reinstall from [brainsfor.dev](https://brainsfor.dev).

### Step 2: Detect Your AI Environment

This brain works across multiple AI tools. Identify which one you're using:

- **Claude Code** — Run this skill directly; brain context loads automatically
- **Cowork (Claude in Slack)** — Use `/brain-setup` command; Cowork syncs context
- **Cursor** — Paste brain-context.md into `.cursor/rules` or project instructions
- **ChatGPT / Claude.ai** — Copy brain-context.md into system prompt or conversation starter
- **Other tools** — Load brain-context.md as your first message or context injection

### Step 3: Load Brain Context

The brain operates in three layers:

1. **Layer 1 — Quick Reference** (brain-atoms.json)
   - JSON structure of 207 atoms with titles, summaries, connections
   - Ideal for: Rapid lookups, programmatic access, integrations
   - Use when: You need structured data for routing or filtering

2. **Layer 2 — Full Knowledge Base** (brain-context.md)
   - Complete narrative knowledge graph with topic tags, people, themes
   - Ideal for: Deep reasoning, strategy sessions, comprehensive understanding
   - Load this file when: Starting a session that requires brain-informed thinking

3. **Layer 3 — Thinking Skills** (the 8 skills below)
   - Each skill is a reasoning mode that produces a distinct type of output
   - Ideal for: Targeted analysis, creative workflows, decision-making
   - Use when: You have a specific type of problem to solve

**Recommended:** Load `brain-context.md` at the start of each session where you want to use the brain. Claude will index it automatically.

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Test your setup with the Quick Start prompt below. You should get a thoughtful response grounded in Sun's thinking.

## The 8 Thinking Skills

Each skill produces a distinct type of output. Use them in combination for more powerful thinking.

### 🧠 **1. /advise** — Strategic Counsel
Ask for advice on decisions grounded in Sun's frameworks. Best for: career moves, company decisions, strategy choices.
*Example: "Should I compete head-on with a larger rival or find an indirect approach?"*

### 📚 **2. /teach** — Explain Like I'm Learning
Get a clear explanation of a concept as Sun sees it. Best for: understanding unfamiliar ideas, building mental models.
*Example: "Explain the concept of shi (strategic advantage) to me."*

### 🔥 **3. /debate** — Steel-Man Both Sides
Present a position or pit two ideas against each other; brain argues the counterpoint. Best for: understanding tradeoffs, challenging assumptions, resolving strategic tensions.
*Example: "Is it always better to avoid direct confrontation?"*

### 🔗 **4. /connect** — Bridge Ideas
Find unexpected connections between two concepts or synthesize multiple ideas into something new. Best for: synthesis, innovation, cross-domain thinking.
*Example: "Connect Sun Tzu's thinking on deception to modern information warfare."*

### 📈 **5. /evolve** — How Ideas Build On Each Other
Trace how a concept develops and changes across the brain. Best for: historical perspective, maturity models, trajectory thinking.
*Example: "How did Sun Tzu's influence evolve from military strategy to business strategy?"*

### 🎨 **6. /surprise** — Unexpected Insights
Get a random high-quality atom you wouldn't think to ask for. Best for: creative breakthroughs, morning inspiration, breaking tunnel vision.
*Example: No input needed — just run it.*

### 🪞 **7. /coach** — Socratic Questions
No answers — just the questions Sun would ask you. Best for: uncovering blind spots, pressure-testing decisions, team discussions.
*Example: "I'm deciding whether to launch aggressively or wait for a better moment. What should I be asking myself?"*

### 🔮 **8. /predict** — Implication Chains
Trace the second and third-order effects of a trend or decision. Best for: forecasting, strategic planning, seeing around corners.
*Example: "What happens when AI gives every competitor perfect information simultaneously?"*

---

## Recommended Workflows

Use these skill combinations for better results:

### 🎯 Decision Workflow
→ `/advise` (get perspective) → `/debate` (stress-test) → `/coach` (check your blind spots)

*Example: Deciding on a hire? Get advice, challenge the reasoning, then surface what you're not asking.*

### 📚 Learning Workflow
→ `/teach` (understand) → `/evolve` (see how it develops) → `/coach` (test your understanding)

*Example: New to Sun Tzu? Teach the core concepts → evolve to see modern applications → coach yourself on your own situation.*

### 💡 Creative Workflow
→ `/surprise` (get inspired) → `/connect` (build bridges) → `/predict` (where does this lead?)

*Example: Stuck on a problem? Surprise + connect often surface unexpected angles.*

### 🔮 Forecast Workflow
→ `/predict` (trace implications) → `/debate` (challenge the prediction) → `/advise` (act on it)

*Example: Facing a strategic decision? Advise on the situation → debate the counterargument → predict the second-order effects.*

### 🌅 Daily Ritual
→ Run `/surprise` each morning for 10 seconds of strategic inspiration.

## Quick Start

**Try this right now to verify setup:**

```
/advise

"I'm entering a market with a much larger competitor who has more resources. How should I approach this?"
```

You should get a thoughtful response that:
- References specific frameworks from the brain
- Weighs tradeoffs from Sun's perspective
- Suggests which of his mental models apply here
- Feels strategic and grounded (not generic)

If you get that, you're all set.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The brain doesn't seem to know what I'm asking about.**
→ Make sure `brain-context.md` is loaded in your session. If using Claude Code, check that the file is in your working directory.

**Q: I want to search the brain for a specific topic.**
→ Use `/advise` with a keyword: `"What does Sun think about strategic positioning?"` → The brain will pull all relevant atoms.

**Q: Can I combine skills?**
→ Absolutely. Chain them: `"First /advise on whether to pivot, then /debate the tradeoffs, then /coach me on what I'm missing."`

**Q: What if a skill doesn't feel relevant to my question?**
→ Try a different one. `/coach` often works when you're stuck; `/connect` when you need something original; `/surprise` when you need inspiration.

**Q: How often should I reload the brain?**
→ Once per session is sufficient. Brain context doesn't expire, and atoms don't change. But if you're switching between different projects, fresh context load = sharper thinking.

## About Sun Tzu

Sun Tzu was a Chinese military strategist and philosopher, traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, an immensely influential treatise on military strategy written around the 5th century BC. His ideas on strategic planning, deception, intelligence gathering, and adaptive leadership have influenced military commanders, business executives, and political leaders for over 2,500 years.

This brain pack extracts and structures his core ideas so you can activate his mental models in your own thinking.

## Sources & Ethics

This brain was built exclusively from **freely available, public sources** — The Art of War (public domain, ~500 BC), publicly available translations, and historical commentary spanning 2,500 years. No transcripts from commercial works (e.g., audiobooks, paid courses) or paywalled essays were used to derive this brain.

Where a thinker's book ideas appear in the knowledge graph, they are represented as they exist in the public discourse: book reviews, author interviews, press coverage, conference talks, and widely discussed concepts. Authors typically share their core ideas through extensive public appearances — those public representations are what this brain captures.
